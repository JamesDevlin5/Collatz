# Collatz Conjecture

([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture))

This program calculates the collatz conjecture series for a given input number.
Each step in the series is plotted as the point `(step_num, collatz_val)`,
so the initial value will be the leftmost point, and the algorithm will progress to the right.
